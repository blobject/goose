*Status:* pre-alpha

Goose is a tcl'ish wayland compositor.

Aspired features include:
- good use of wlroots (device detection, multi-monitor, screensharing, etc.)
- control, configuration, hackability via tcl, json
- gui hackability via tk
- stacked windows by default
- grouping (tabs, piles, concats)
- tagging (workspace-like behavior)
- marking (for quick focusing)
- overview (mac's expos√©, spaces, mosaic, etc.; an extended alt-tab; a graphical configuration tool)

** Why

- want some practice with c + tcl and shipping a complete program
- tcl and tk are awesome
- wayland seems to hold a bright future
- yet to see a stacking wayland window manager (at least packaged for the distro that I use) that works intuitively, that works in a way that I like by default (cwm, openbox), and whose near-core behavior is easily customisable
- want to experiment with seemingly cool ui, layout, ipc ideas
- called "goose" because when you get tcl'd, you get goose-bumps
